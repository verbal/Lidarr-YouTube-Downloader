**Lidarr YouTube Downloader** is a modern, lightweight web tool that bridges the gap between **Lidarr** and **YouTube**.

It automatically fetches your "Missing" albums list from Lidarr, allows you to download them directly from YouTube as high-quality MP3s, injects correct metadata (including **MusicBrainz IDs** and **Cover Art**), and triggers an automatic import in Lidarr.

**No torrents or Usenet required.** Perfect for filling gaps in your library.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**Q: I get "HTTP Error 403: Forbidden" in logs.**  
**A:** This image uses the latest `yt-dlp` and custom headers to emulate a real browser, minimizing YouTube blocks. Ensure you are using the `:latest` tag.

**Q: Lidarr shows "Import Failed".**  
**A:**
1. Ensure `DOWNLOAD_PATH` matches exactly in both the Container and Lidarr's Root Folder settings.
2. Ensure `LIDARR_URL` is the actual LAN IP of your server, not `localhost`.

**Q: Files are downloaded but Lidarr rejects them.**  
**A:** This tool injects `MusicBrainz Album Id` into the files. Lidarr should accept them automatically. If not, check your Lidarr Metadata Profile settings.
